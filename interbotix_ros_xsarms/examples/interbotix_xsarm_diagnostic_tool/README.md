## Overview

This package is meant to be used as a way to analyze joint data over time. For example, if the user would like the arm to perform a certain task but is not sure if it will 'strain' a specific arm joint too much, then this tool would be an easy way to record, save (to a rosbag and CSV file), and view data live while the joint in question rotates.
